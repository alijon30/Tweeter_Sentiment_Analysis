This is a sentiment analysis project that analyzes the sentiment of movie reviews, Twitter tweets, and Amazon product reviews.

Introduction
Sentiment analysis is the process of extracting the emotions or opinions expressed in a piece of text. It is a useful technique in many applications, such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and market research.

This project uses natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The datasets used for this project are movie reviews, Twitter tweets, and Amazon product reviews.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.6 or higher
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Tweepy (for Twitter sentiment analysis)
TextBlob (for sentiment analysis of short texts)
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
For Twitter sentiment analysis, you will need to create a Twitter API key and access token. Follow the instructions here to create a Twitter developer account and obtain the necessary credentials. Then, create a config.py file in the src directory and add your Twitter API keys and access tokens as follows:
python
Copy code
consumer_key = 'your_consumer_key'
consumer_secret = 'your_consumer_secret'
access_token = 'your_access_token'
access_token_secret = 'your_access_token_secret'
Usage
To perform sentiment analysis on the datasets, run the following command in your terminal:

python
Copy code
python main.py
This will run the sentiment analysis on all the datasets and output the results to the console.

Results
The sentiment analysis results are saved to CSV files in the data directory. The CSV files contain the original text, the predicted sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and the confidence score for each prediction.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis on different types of text data. The results can be used to gain insights into the emotions and opinions of people about movies, products, and topics discussed on Twitter.
